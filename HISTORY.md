The people described in this document made significant and/or recurring contributions to Yarn in various aspects. Please don't edit this list as part of a feature or bugfix PR.

Note that it's sometimes hard to keep track of everyone (the v1 trunk has 500+ contributors, and the v2 trunk already 29), so this list is by no means extensive. Still, it provides a decent picture of who to contact for information in case we later lose context over something.
